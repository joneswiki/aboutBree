                        <li> Time reveals people. Give people 5 months to hurt you. If I dont give ppl access to me. They take. Its so familiar. Never earn or ask.</li>
                        <li> Get selfish. Make them wait forever. Men are allowed to have the biggest egos. Half of the population voted for hatred.</li>
                        <li> They love this country, they criticize and protest because they want it to be better. But it does not love you. remember that.</li>
                        <li> Don't underestimate a whisper network.</li>
                        <li> Ppl can only percieve you based on their own experiences.</li>
                        <li> People are so complex. And then there's that 1 boy that swears he summed you up & treats you like you have no self respect but will pretend to be charming.</li>

                        <li>History trains the present. Future generations will see us as behind, due to their perspective in time.</li>
                        <li>Leaving it up to the states is righteous to decrease fed power? Why not do one better and leave it up to the individual? Its reminds me of the question "wife or child" but in order to pick the wife you need documentation, a judge, lawyer & time they don't have.</li>
                        <li>Ppl underestimate how much our gvmt/corps profit from pouring billions into war/the police. Some ppl dying = uproar. Others die silently = paycheck. Either way ppl don't respect soldiers like they claim to do. They swear its not that simple.</li>
                        <li>There are actually people who believe Trickle-Down economics works.</li>
                        <li>I dont always agree with Disney on alot, but one thing it gets right is the idea of women/mothers doing anything to avoid the feeeling of grief.</li>
