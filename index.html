            <h2>Fav Questions.</h2
            <p> The answers say a lot about you.</p>
            <ol>
                <li class="favorite-question">Favorite Disney Princess/Prince? Why? Harry Potter House? Marvel character? Why?
                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li>Elsa. Independent. Powerful. Before Elsa, Aurora. My nickname was Sleeping Beauty because I was always sleeping.</li>
                        <li>I aspire to be more like Belle because she's patient, empathetic, and a book lover.</li>
                        <li>#1 = Kristoff. Protective, quiet, calm, and kind.</li>
                        <li>#2 = Li Shang. Mulan respects him because he's deserving of respect.</li>
                        <li>#3 = John Smith. A peacemaker. He accepts Pocahontas for who she is.</li>
                        <li>I thought Ravenclaw, but maybe Hufflepuff.</li>
                        <li>Scarlett Witch. Miles Morales. Teenager. I think young Marvel will promising, ppl just refuse to enter new ages</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                 
                <li class="favorite-question">Life lessons
                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li> Normativity is a myth. Explore/Experiment with the world while we're here. Expose yourself to different people/lifestyles. You'll find what you like & what you don't.</li>
                        <li> Perception is reality. Fiction/Cinema/S.M is not reality, its fantasy. But like other types of art it has concepts of reality altho usually the extremes: glamourized or villionous.</li>
                        <li> The types of questions you ask/your type of humor says a lot about you.</li>
                        <li> Time reveals people. Give people 5 months to hurt you. If I dont give ppl access to me. They take. It's so familiar. Never earn or just ask.</li>
                        <li> Those who love this country criticize and protest because they want it to be better. But it does not love them or want to listen to understand. It responds by rejecting reasoning or using violence like tug a war. remember that.</li>
                        <li> America is like you we gave your grandparents rights later than everyone else, we're not racist anymore. But be macroaggressive. Its as simple as ignorance/shaming black culture while smiling in your face then claiming to accept black bodies or extremely mainstream rap. It tends to be the ppl who agree with book bans or hates critical race theory/dei. Cuz why so mad.</li>
                        <li> Don't underestimate a whisper network and how easily people can be manipulated into hating someone they didn't even take the time to know.</li>
                        <li> Ppl can only percieve you based on their own experiences with themselves or others. Projection or its normal for them to be around really shitty ppl. ppl will hurt others out of fear of being hurt which is stupid btw.</li>
                        <li> Humans are so complex. They can both suck at nuance/empathy.</li>
                        <li> Red flags: act differently in a group than alone; turn into a diff person intoxicated; When mad, they insult/attack; Can't control intoxication; Can't take anything seriously; not voting. we got it only 60 yrs ago, its important to me; Gossipers/ppl who can't stay out of your business & rush to tell everyone - which is somehow normalized; ppl who don't tell you when someone's talking about you; ppl who can judge someone's looks/weight cuz its never necessary.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li class="favorite-question">How would your friends describe you?
                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li> Curious, responsible, reasonable.</li>
                        <li> Loves quiet/independence.</li>   
                        <li> Quiet but Attentive.</li>
                        <li> Spontaneous/Chaotic.</li>
                        <li> A "Mother." idc I'm gonna be a great mother.</li>
                        <li> I want ppl to be known as someone they trust not to hurt them.</li>
                        <li> If I get rich im making the most fire dating/social/party/job seeking/volunteer/shopping app known to human kind.</li>          
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li class="favorite-question">The rules you live by?
                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li> Ppl waste so much energy picking ppl apart. Use that energy to learn about why they do what they do, who they are. If you dont vibe its easy to avoid them. </li>
                        <li> Your partner/friends are a reflection of your morals/values. If you don't set high expectations for these ppl, you'll feel like you're playing a part. And sometimes you don't even realize how important this is until you're im toxic environments. A good person won't erase how you feel.</li>
                        <li> You try to see to best in ppl / be considerate, but they take it too far. Then you get tired of them slandering you so you ghost, & somehow its a bad thing. Ppl want you to stay cause they like having someone to run over.</li>
                        <li> Life is about experiencing everything you can especially if its unknown. Life is about balance. Life is also about recognizing your privalage like simply being a natural u.s citizen. Life means nothing and is everything. thats why i love coming if age books.</li>
                        <li> From the male gaze it's not a big deal, from the female gaze it can be terrifying. That's why we need more female directors/leaders/politicians. The opposite sex can not see the world in the same way. We were meant to work in harmony as 50%/50% of the pop. The gender role harm hasn't ended yet. One sex contributes to most of the violence. Point it out. No one bats an eye.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="favorite-question">What traits/people do you feel most drawn to?

                        <li> Introverts.</li>
                        <li> Emotional Intelligence/Empathy.</li>
                        <li> Patience.</li>
                        <li> Independent thinkers.</li>

                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li> Teddy Roosevelt.</li>

                        <li>“I have no mercy or compassion in me for a society that will crush people and then penalize them for not being able to stand up under the weight.” - Malcolm X</li>
                        <li>“My alma mater was books, a good library… I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity.” - Malcolm X</li>
                        <li>"There is no better teacher than adversity. Every defeat, every heartbreak, every loss, contains its own seed, its own lesson on how to improve your performance the next time." - Malcolm X</li>
                        <li>"The media's the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power. Because they control the minds of the masses." - Malcolm X</li>

                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li>It's the principle of things.</li>
                        <li>We need to dim the Sun... See how that shit makes no sense. adhd is being creative but having to be realistic.</li>
                        <li>History trains the present. Future generations will see us as behind, due to their perspective in time, just like some of us now see the past.</li>
                        <li>Disney does get right a women/mother's intense desire to avoid the pit of grief. </li>
                        <li>My search history does not means much cause I look up anything that pops in my head.</li>
                        <li>My favorite lore is that i can not find anyone attractive until i hear the intelligence/mindset/type of humor. And politics. It'll be obvious if its all for show, but idgaf i'd rather be single than compromise.</li>
                        <li>"Young and Beautiful." "Teenage Dream." They say older women are forgotten. Patience because I don't plan to marry twice.</li>
                        <li>"Lonely Child", "Heart on Ice", "Sometimes." Despite what fascade our men put up, they just want to be loved.</li>
                        <li>Why women chase money is simple & traditional. Both sides will bash you for not being as attractive at any given time even during insane stress. Girls don't support girls as much as boys have double standards. Wealth = Time = the illusion of Health = Beauty. Some girls may be conditioned to obtain it/maintain it through men. Some girls dream of making their own. In the age we're allowed economic freedom, but this is new.</li>
                        <li>Realistically though some men chase beautiful women they can't have. The college/S.M bubble normalizes access to atrractive people especially if you're not used to it. They ofc also love money. like girls dream of their wedding, men always have a dream car(s).</li>
                        <li>I still stand by the idea of houses by character traits cuz we'd have sm fun & none of the nonsense of seperating the sexes or maintaining outdated ideas or bad club parties. Cuz as a boy id be mad asf too if my options were being upsold to bad parties, rush, or pay for real clubbing/bars.</li>
                        <li>first question has to be where do you want to live upon graduation. I'm simply not made for the cold.</li>   
                        <li>i miss nyc underground. dying in the mosh somehow ending up on the other side of the room, drill, vibes til 3am. It can't be replicated. i don't like bar style fun.</li>
                        <li>Marriage is scary cause what if he doesn't like raves,clubbing,arcades,books,nature,critical thinking,have a good sense of humor or like sitting in silence.</li>
