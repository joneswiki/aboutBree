                        <li>I aspire to be more like Belle because she's patient, empathetic, and a book lover.</li>
                        <li>#1 = Kristoff. Protective, quiet, calm, and kind.</li>
                        <li>#2 = Li Shang. Mulan respects him because he's deserving of respect.</li>

                <li class="favorite-question">Life lessons
                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li> Normativity is a myth. Explore/Experiment with the world while we're here. Expose yourself to different people/lifestyles. You'll find what you like & what you don't.</li>
                        <li> Perception is reality. Fiction/Cinema/S.M is not reality, its fantasy. But like other types of art it has concepts of reality altho usually the extremes: glamourized or villionous.</li>
                        <li> The types of questions you ask/your type of humor says a lot about you.</li>
                        <li> Time reveals people. If I don't give ppl access to me. They take. It's so familiar. Never earn or just ask.</li>
                        <li> Those who love this country criticize b/c they want it to be better. But it does not care or want to listen. It responds by rejecting reasoning or using violence like tug a war. remember that.</li>
                        <li> America is like you we gave your grandparents rights only 60 yrs ago, we're not racist anymore. Its macroaggressive/purposely hidden. Its as simple as ignorance toward black culture, filtering history, while claiming to accept black bodies. It tends to be the ppl who agree with book bans or hates critical race theory/dei. Cuz we don't even make it that big of a deal but they do.</li>
                        <li> Don't underestimate a whisper network and how easily people can be manipulated into hating someone they don't even know. Ppl be messy, twisting words but words hold power.</li>
                        <li> Ppl can only percieve you based on their own experiences with themselves or others. Alot of projection.</li>        
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li class="favorite-question">How would your friends describe you?
                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li> Curious, reasonable.</li>
                        <li> Prefers quiet/independence.</li>   
                        <li> Quiet but Attentive.</li>
                        <li> Chaotic.</li>
                        <li> A "Mother." Idc i'm gonna be a great mother.</li>
                        <li> I would like be known as someone they trust not to hurt them, a good human. Ppl think I judge like we all do but it's not negative judgment its I haven't been exposed to this life, but I can learn.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li class="favorite-question">The rules you live by?
                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li> Your partner/friends are a reflection of your morals/values. But we are imperfect & complex.</li>
                        <li> A great author seeks to know every story.</li>
                        <li> Be open-minded. Date outside ur race. love can come from anywhere. Like friendship.</li>
                        <li> You try to be considerate, but they gossip & don't respect privacy. ghost. they would not want that done to them & they can't police how u react. its simple: u can be mean just be loud with it so I know who to stay tf away. </li>
                        <li> Life is about: experiencing everything you can; balance; appreciating your privalage like simply being a natural u.s citizen. Life means nothing and is everything. Thats why i love coming of age books. Everyone's trying to navigate this wrld.</li>
                        <li> From the male gaze it's not a big deal, from the female gaze it can be terrifying. That's why we need more female directors/leaders/politicians. The opposite sex can not see the world in the same way. We were meant to work in harmony as 50%/50%. The gender role harm exists. One sex contributes to the majority of the violence.</li>

                        <li>"I feel like I'm in a board game, and I don't know any of the rules. (Pause) Like chess. I never really figured out chess." - Ginny S1E2</li>
                        <li>"We think we know what's going on with other people, but we don't... We all have blind spots." - Marcus S2E8</li>
                        <li>“I have no mercy or compassion in me for a society that will crush people and then penalize them for not being able to stand up under the weight.” - Malcolm X</li>
                        <li>“My alma mater was books, a good library… I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity.” - Malcolm X</li>
                        <li>"There is no better teacher than adversity. Every defeat, every heartbreak, every loss, contains its own seed, its own lesson on how to improve your performance the next time." - Malcolm X</li>
                        <li>"The media's the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and to make the guilty innocent, and that's power. Because they control the minds of the masses." - Malcolm X</li>
                        <li>"A man who stands for nothing will fall for anything." - Malcolm X</li>
                        <li>"Faith, that faculty that enables us to believe what we know to be untrue." - Dracula</li>

                    <ul class="answer">
                        <li>It's the principle of things.</li>
                        <li>Fitting in a certain group does not make them a hivemind even tho ppl generalize.</li>
                        <li>I love diversity b/c i learn alot by exposure & listening. Different races = diff perspectives like beauty standards & problems they face in society. I've never learned more about Asian cultures than here. how ppl were raised speaks volumes. Btwn every race, its always familiar but different in different ways.</li>
                        <li>We need to dim the Sun... see how that shit makes no sense. adhd is being creative, but having to be realistic in this grey world.</li>
                        <li>History trains the present. Future generations will see us as behind, due to their perspective in time, just like some of us now see the past.</li>
                        <li>Disney does get right a woman/mother's intense desire to avoid the pit of grief.</li>
                        <li>My search history does not mean much. I literally look up everything that pops in my head.</li>
                        <li>My favorite lore is that i can not find anyone attractive until i hear their mindset/how they treat all living things. It'll be obvious if its all for show, but idgaf i'd rather be single than compromise.</li>
                        <li>"Young and Beautiful." "Teenage Dream." They say older women are forgotten. Patience because I don't plan to marry twice.</li>
                        <li>"Lonely Child", "Sometimes", any Lewis Capaldi. Despite what fascade men put up, they just want to be loved.</li>
                        <li>Why women chase money is simple/traditional. Both sides will bash you for not being as attractive at any given time even during insane stress. Some women don't support women as much as boys have double/crazy standards. Wealth = Time = the illusion of Health = Beauty. Some girls may be conditioned to obtain/maintain it through men. Some girls will make their own. Our economic freedom is new.</li>
                        <li>Realistically, tho some men chase beautiful women. The college/S.M bubble normalizes attractive ppl espec if you're not used to it. Besides everyone loves money. like girls dream of their wedding, men always have a dream car(s). I understand tho cuz what if I can't afford an Escalade.</li>
                        <li>I still stand by the idea of houses by vibe cuz we'd have sm fun & none of the nonsense of seperating the sexes. Cuz as a boy I'd be mad asf too if my options were pledge, or pay for usc clubs or clubbing/bars.</li>
                        <li>First question has to be where do you want to live upon graduation. B/c tf i look like being in cold climates. Also edit answers. And have a top10.</li>   
                        <li>i miss nyc underground. dying in the mosh, somehow ending up on the other side of the room, stoners/skaters, drill, vibes til 3am. It can't be replicated. Bar-style fun is not my taste. I respect the different types of fun tho.</li>
                        <li>Marriage is scary cause what if he isn't into raves,arcades,books,cooking,nature,slightly possessive, doesn't have a good sense of humor, or isn't able to sit in silence. I don't expect perfection. I do expect go-karts & racing around the neighborhood while being menaces. to each its own.</li>
